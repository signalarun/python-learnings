# PYTHON LEARNINGS
* This documents some snipets which I found different from other programing languages.

# NumPy 
  * A library for numerical computing
  * ndarray
    - Python provides datastructures like LIST, DICTONARY. But operating on them is done using iterative loops which is 
      computationally inefficient. Numpy provides 'ndarray' for this.
    - Unlike ndarray objects, matrix objects are two dimensional
    - Its ndarray bit depth defaults to that of python environment ie. for 64 bit its length will be 64. Use type specification     
      for these types of arrays
  * Record array
