# PYTHON LEARNINGS
* This documents some snipets which I found different from other programing languages.

# NumPy 
  * A library for numerical computing
  * Python provides datastructures like LIST, DICTONARY. But operating on them is done using iterative loops which is 
    computationally inefficient. Numpy provides 'ndarrray' for this.
